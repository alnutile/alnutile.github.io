Right now it seems that since bower ends up putting all assets into bower_components (css and js) and elixir wants assets by default in resources/assets/css and js that I need to have an easy way to get the files via bower and then get them to the needed folders.
For most project we actually leave the files in the git repo for faster ui testing builds and we rarely run updates but when we do it would be nice for bower to also be able to work and not mess any of the above settings not cause me to have to manually move files around.</description></item></channel></rss>
