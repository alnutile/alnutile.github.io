Easily Create Fixture Data from Remote Services and Refresh Mock Data We have integration tests that hit remote apis like Github, S3, DynomoDB, our own APIs etc and we do not want to hit those during out tests but we also want to make sure we have the real data. So when one of those APIs change then our mock data can be refreshed to see if our systems really work with it.</description></item></channel></rss>
