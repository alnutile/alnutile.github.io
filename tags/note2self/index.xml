This means I put files in the tests/fixtures folder that represet the JSON of what ever I am testing. For example maybe I hit an API that returns
{ &amp;#34;foo&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;bar&amp;#34; } And when I mock that API response I want to have that ready for me to use.
I then save it to the folder tests/fixtures/foo.json and can just use it.</description></item><item><title>Using Python Lambda behind and ALB</title><link>https://alfrednutile.info/posts/266/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alfrednutile.info/posts/266/</guid><description>Just a quick note to self about ALB and Lambda. When using Lambda behind and ALB for routing your response has to be formatted properly else you will get a 502.
https://pypi.org/project/alb-response/ solved this problem.
from alb_response import alb_response
def lambda_handler(event, context):
response_dict = process_the_event(event)
return alb_response(
http_status=200,
json=response_dict,
is_base64_encoded=False,

The results are easy enough to do by hand but I had a bit of time really finding out the format to respond with other than JavaScript and that casing there was a bit confusing.</description></item><item><title>Lambda Tips</title><link>https://alfrednutile.info/posts/264/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alfrednutile.info/posts/264/</guid><description>@WIP

This can end up being a Controller class that does a lot of filters off the Request. Or it can be a Repository class that abstracts the business logic into one place for several related models.
But in many cases it really is just one Model being filtered.</description></item><item><title>Valet Laravel 7.1 and 7.2</title><link>https://alfrednutile.info/posts/253/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alfrednutile.info/posts/253/</guid><description>..</description></item><item><title>Python3 Fixtures</title><link>https://alfrednutile.info/posts/252/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alfrednutile.info/posts/252/</guid><description>Just a reminder using pickle I can easily make fixtures for testing.

If you are running queues locally, for what ever reason, then any changes you make in code you need to restart your queue daemon.
php artisan queue:restart
This will cause the daemon to look at a timestamp and restart if that is newer than before &amp;ldquo;e.g. you ran the above. And this will force the in memory process to update itself from the latest code base.</description></item><item><title>Query Strings and VueJS</title><link>https://alfrednutile.info/posts/244/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alfrednutile.info/posts/244/</guid><description>Quick way to make the url reflect the query string so the user can share the url and filters.
This is component based VueJS building so not an SPA But I still install &amp;quot;vue-router&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;^3.0.1&amp;quot;
And load it
import VueRouter from 'vue-router';
Vue.use(VueRouter);
The on the component I set a watch on the router.
watch: {
$route(to, from) {
this.setModelFromQueryString();
this.search();

In this case it will set the query strings then trigger the &amp;ldquo;search&amp;rdquo; to load the data into the page.</description></item><item><title>BrowserSync and Laravel</title><link>https://alfrednutile.info/posts/239/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alfrednutile.info/posts/239/</guid><description>Quick reminder to take advantage of this amazing feature https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/mix#browsersync-reloading

One interesting package example is aws/aws-sdk-php
If you look in it&amp;rsquo;s composer.json you will see this
&amp;quot;require&amp;quot;: {
&amp;quot;php&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;&amp;gt;=5.5&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;guzzlehttp/guzzle&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;~5.3|~6.0.1|~6.1&amp;quot;,

&amp;quot;mtdowling/jmespath.php&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;~2.2&amp;quot;

So it allows for other libraries to choose as needed and it will deal with the different versions as needed.</description></item><item><title>Chrome update equals Behat Fail</title><link>https://alfrednutile.info/posts/197/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Nov 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alfrednutile.info/posts/197/</guid><description>Had trouble running behat after I ran updates on Chrome

The difference is require versus require_once in PHPUnit tests.
For example
require __DIR__ . '/../ConfigurationExamples/routes.php';
Route::get('/', function () {
return view('welcome');
});
Now when I run my tests I get 100% pass
/**
* @test
*/
public function should_auth_user()
{
$user = factory(\App\User::class)-&amp;gt;create();
$results = $this-&amp;gt;call('GET', sprintf(&amp;quot;/example/auth_token?api_token=%s&amp;quot;, $user-&amp;gt;api_token));
$this-&amp;gt;assertEquals(200, $results-&amp;gt;status());
$this-&amp;gt;assertEquals(&amp;quot;foo&amp;quot;, $results-&amp;gt;getContent());
}
/**
* @test
*/
public function should_fail_user()
{
$results = $this-&amp;gt;call('GET', '/example/auth_token');
$this-&amp;gt;assertEquals(302, $results-&amp;gt;status());

$this-&amp;gt;assertEquals(&amp;quot;foo&amp;quot;, $results-&amp;gt;getContent());
}
The moment I change it to require_once I get fails on the last or second to last one, it is not consistant except that it will fail.</description></item><item><title>Install Webdriver to get testing with Behat and Javascript</title><link>https://alfrednutile.info/posts/174/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alfrednutile.info/posts/174/</guid><description>This is so I do not forget!

$env = $app-&amp;gt;detectEnvironment(function()

brew tap josegonzalez/php
brew install phpsh
and finally add this to the ~/.bash_profile
