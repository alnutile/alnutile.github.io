Example repo is here https://github.com/alnutile/oauth_how_to
The library we will use is
https://github.com/lucadegasperi/oauth2-server-laravel
This will setup a server both client_type and password_type for Grant Types.
Coming to Terms with Oauth Coming to terms with this stuff is long and tedious. The docs are here https://github.com/lucadegasperi/oauth2-server-laravel/ wiki will help and then these lead to the League docs as well http://oauth2.thephpleague.com/
There is also a podcast interview with the Alex Bilbie who made the League Oauth Library http://fullstackradio.</description></item><item><title>Dealing with Oauth2 Server and Laravel for both a local app login and for remote apps using Lucadegasperi/oauth2-server-laravel</title><link>https://alnutile.github.io/posts/133/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alnutile.github.io/posts/133/</guid><description>This is all based around this library https://github.com/lucadegasperi/oauth2-server-laravel
I am building and API to be used by an iOs and Android client I will be making soon. But I also needed the filter system to deal with my local Laravel view that was using the api via an Angular driven widget so the user can go to the website as well.
So the website is where the user can go to do change settings, subscription updates etc, but in that case they are logged in via the Laravel login form.</description></item></channel></rss>
