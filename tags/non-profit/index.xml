Pretty amazing drop in interface to manage a site. I am building a Speakers Bureau for a non-profit and ended up using this to make that part of the build easier.<a href="http://activeadmin.info/">http://activeadmin.info/</a></p><p>
My only fear was bringing in way more than I needed but so far it is okay because of how hookable it is.</p><p>
I have dealt with other systems that can be a pain to hook so I am still always nervous about that moment when the hook takes more time than if you built it your self.</p><p>
Activeadmin takes your models and makes the forms needed to manage them on the fly. The one issue I has was a model with no field it could figure to use as the select label. So all I had to do was set my model to have add<code>alias_attribute :name, :firstname</code> to the model that was having an issue. (not the belongs_to model but the has_many) and it just worked.</p><p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/54803135/active_admin.png" width="400"/></description><tags>non-profit</tags></item></channel></rss>
