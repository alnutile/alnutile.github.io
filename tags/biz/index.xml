Hourly Rates We will discuss my hourly rate before starting the work. Once agreed, we can then talk about feature(s) that the business would like me to build or assist in building. I try to avoid Waterfall projects 1 or digging too deep into feature months down the roadmap since often goals change, and that time is then not a good use of budget or time.</description></item></channel></rss>
