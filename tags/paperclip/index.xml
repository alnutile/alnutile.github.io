This took a bit. On the first site it was easy. I went through<a href="https://github.com/galetahub/ckeditor" target="_blank">these directions</a> to get ckeditor setup with paperclip.<br/>
And paperclip is easy to setup with S3 but on this site you are reading now the url Amazon used was not<strong>s3</strong>.amazonaws.com/nutilesblog but<strong>s3-us-west-2</strong>.amazonaws.com/nutilesblog&nbsp;</p><p>Paperclip was defaulting to s3 and I had trouble getting the combinations for this setting right. Maybe I could have set the bucket to use s3 but in the end I rather deal with the s3-us-west-2 since different clients will have different needs.</p><p><br/>
Finally I setup the development.rb and production.rb like this<br><script src="https://gist.github.com/alnutile/6205464.js"/><br><p>You can see the URL below of the image and the PDF</p><p><img alt="" src="http://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/nutilesblog/var/www/alsstuff2Cap/releases/20130811161031/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/7/content_website.jpg" style="height:252px; width:300px"/></p><p>And a PDF</p><p><a href="http://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/nutilesblog/var/www/alsstuff2Cap/releases/20130811161031/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/8/original_testpdf.pdf">http://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/nutilesblog/var/www/alsstuff2Cap/releases/20130811161031/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/8/original_testpdf.pdf</a></p></description><tags>paperclip</tags></item></channel></rss>
