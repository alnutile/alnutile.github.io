Using Github pages with no theme we can use that repo to then pull in our help files to our local project via a JSON request. This separates documentation from the project so anyone on the team can checkout the git branch for the docs, make an edit and push to that branch which then shows on the site in minutes.
To start with take the repo you are using to make a new branch called gh-pages as noted here Github Docs&amp;nbsp;</description></item></channel></rss>
