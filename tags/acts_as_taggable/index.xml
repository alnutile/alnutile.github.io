Even RailsCasts has a how-to on making a tag cloud, as well as act_as_taggable&amp;rsquo;s guthub page. But I just could not see how to limit to a context other than :tag&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So maybe I was missing the obvious but all I wanted was to output a clickable list on a sidebar so users can filter content from that list.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The code took place in
app/helpers/application_helper.rb
Since I wanted to use it in a shared partial&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I noticed too that the person who posted the solution just read the code! Sometimes it is too easy to google.&lt;/p></description><category>acts_as_taggable</category></item></channel></rss>
