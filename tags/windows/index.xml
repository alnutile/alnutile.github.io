With WSL2 out and a great laptop I wanted to give this another try.
MariaDB Even though the install is super simple see onnectondemand.pfizer.com/pfizermfa/sslvpn/pfizercontrollerlogin.jsp?profile=pfizerprofile&amp;amp;flowname=aidauth#no-back-button
I still end up having to do:
$ sudo mysql -u root # I had to use &amp;quot;sudo&amp;quot; since is new installation
mysql&amp;gt; USE mysql;
mysql&amp;gt; UPDATE user SET plugin='mysql_native_password' WHERE User='root';
mysql&amp;gt; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
mysql&amp;gt; exit;
$ service mysql restart
To allow me to then use this command, for example maraidb -uroot -proot otherwise I have &amp;ldquo;Error connecting on localhost&amp;rdquo; type errors.</description></item><item><title>Windows Dev Box Try 2 2018</title><link>https://alnutile.github.io/posts/247/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alnutile.github.io/posts/247/</guid><description>Going to list somethings as I go.
