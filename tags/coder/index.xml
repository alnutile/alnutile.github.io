Though there is no ONE way to do any of this there are ways that scale better than others. But more importantly having one way as a team to do things can be key to projects from beginning to end (eg the rest of the projects life!)</p><h1 id="project-style-guides">Project Style Guides</h1><p><a href="https://kindle.amazon.com/work/the-clean-coder-professional-programmers-ebook/B004SJU478/B0050JLC9Y">The Clean Coder</a> by Robert Martin book is a look at being a &ldquo;Professional&rdquo; coder and all that comes with it.
It is a great look at not only how one should be in the role of a Programmer but what to expect of each other as a team.</p><p><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51MoTaVrS7L._SS130_.jpg" alt="clean code"/><p><a href="https://kindle.amazon.com/work/domain-driven-design-tackling-complexity-software-ebook/B001KBG6RO/B00794TAUG">Domain Driven Deisgn</a>
A great look at being a programmer that not only makes code but more importantly bridges the gap between the vision of the business with the goals of the code.</p><p><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51WLtI-uLcL._SS130_.jpg" alt="ddd"/><hr><h1 id="php-style-guides">PHP Style Guides</h1><p>Back to Robert Martin again on this to start<a href="https://kindle.amazon.com/work/clean-code-handbook-software-craftsmanship-ebook/B001GTWCJG/B001GSTOAM">Clean Code</a></p><p>It is not about PHP directly but it all applies to good Oo PHP design patterns and thinking. There are so many classics he quotes that could be added here as well.</p><p><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41XojFFhYlL._SS130_.jpg" alt="clean code"/><hr><h1 id="angular-style-guides">Angular Style Guides</h1><p>I use to start with Angular Seed but always thought it fell short when the project grew and this guide made it clear to me why. IMO it is a much better approach to Angular<a href="https://github.com/johnpapa/angularjs-styleguide">John Papa</a>. This guide includes examples which is great.</p><hr><h1 id="api-guides">API Guides</h1><p>There are a number of great books on this as well. Right now a short and simple look at how to make an API, I think, is<a href="https://leanpub.com/build-apis-you-wont-hate">Build APIs You Won&rsquo;t Hate</a> by Phil Sturgeon. Great code example too on Behat and API testing</p><p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/titlepages.leanpub.com/build-apis-you-wont-hate/small?1408731468" alt="apis"/><hr><h1 id="uml-20">UML 2.0</h1><p>A unified means to communicate ideas to each other and to product owners. Before digging into code this is a great way for teams to communicate all the way from higher level overview down to the classes and constructors.</p><p>Seems the Gang of Four book, Robert Martin books and Domain Driven Design all point to this as a way to sketch out ideas or even use it as a long term blueprint to go hand and hand with deployed code. The<a href="http://www.amazon.com/UML-2-0-Nutshell-OReilly-ebook/dp/B0026OR2L8/ref=tmm_kin_title_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;sr=8-1&amp;qid=1410697423">UML 2.0 in a Nutshell</a> along with the more in depth O&rsquo;Reilly book UML 2.0 second edition.</p><p><img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41FVsizkpIL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg" alt="nutshell"/><hr><h1 id="bdd--tdd">BDD / TDD</h1><p>Testing is really key I think know one anymore doubts that. What you end up with is Code that you can refactor and make better over time with confidence. And as a team that is important. It also leads to one of the best sources of documentation. This presentation talks about<a href="https://amsterdam2014.drupal.org/session/doing-behaviour-driven-development-behat">BDD</a> and<a href="http://everzet.com/post/99045129766/introducing-modelling-by-example">article</a> really take it to the next level. As the test become the glue between the goals of the business and the code of the developers.</p><h1 id="final-notes">Final Notes</h1><p>Robert Martin really hones in for me why testing is so important. It is not about TDD in the end<strong>but maintainable and changeable code</strong>. And so even though much of the above seems like more work upfront it really leads to better code and better experiences as a coder and more importantly as a team.</p><p>Also Pair programming is a great use of time and should not be feared. Too much of it wears me out but just the right amount can be a powerful way to get a team member up to speed on a new part to a project or just to check in with each other and spend some time coding and growing as a team. It is scary to share in something as personal as coding but in the end we all can learn from each other.</p><hr><h1 id="misc-reads">Misc Reads</h1><p>Not as key as the ones above imo but still super helpful. Though POODR could easily be moved above.</p><h2 id="practical-object-oriented-design-in-ruby-an-agile-primerhttpskindleamazoncomworkpractical-object-oriented-design-ruby-addison-wesley-ebookb0096gequeb0096byg7c"><a href="https://kindle.amazon.com/work/practical-object-oriented-design-ruby-addison-wesley-ebook/B0096GEQUE/B0096BYG7C">Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby: An Agile Primer</a></h2><p><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51lFbn3LPCL._SS130_.jpg" alt="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51lFbn3LPCL.SS130.jpg"/><h2 id="php-objects-patterns-and-practicehttpskindleamazoncomworkobjects-patterns-practice-experts-source-ebookb003xrx1qmb003xqf3nw"><a href="https://kindle.amazon.com/work/objects-patterns-practice-experts-source-ebook/B003XRX1QM/B003XQF3NW">PHP Objects, Patterns and Practice</a></h2><p><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51bJaFjTZnL._SS130_.jpg" alt="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51bJaFjTZnL.SS130.jpg"/><h2 id="laravel-from-apprentice-to-artisanhttpsleanpubcomlaravel"><a href="https://leanpub.com/laravel">Laravel: From Apprentice To Artisan</a></h2><p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/titlepages.leanpub.com/laravel/small?1387959278" alt="https://s3.amazonaws.com/titlepages.leanpub.com/laravel/small?1387959278"/><h2 id="eloquent-javascript-a-modern-introduction-to-programminghttpskindleamazoncomworkeloquent-javascript-modern-introduction-programming-ebookb00409onimb004oejnq0"><a href="https://kindle.amazon.com/work/eloquent-javascript-modern-introduction-programming-ebook/B00409ONIM/B004OEJNQ0">Eloquent JavaScript: A Modern Introduction to Programming</a></h2><p><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/519WDGN-9DL._SS130_.jpg" alt="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/519WDGN-9DL.SS130.jpg"/><h2 id="nodejs-the-right-way-practical-server-side-javascript-that-scaleshttpskindleamazoncomworknode-js-right-way-server-side-javascript-ebookb00hsocscyb00hso6yd8"><a href="https://kindle.amazon.com/work/node-js-right-way-server-side-javascript-ebook/B00HSOCSCY/B00HSO6YD8">Node.js the Right Way: Practical, Server-Side JavaScript That Scales</a></h2><p><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51%2BVjuSvKJL._SS130_.jpg" alt="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51%2BVjuSvKJL.SS130.jpg"/><h2 id="the-pragmatic-programmer-from-journeyman-to-masterhttpskindleamazoncomworknode-js-right-way-server-side-javascript-ebookb00hsocscyb00hso6yd8"><a href="https://kindle.amazon.com/work/node-js-right-way-server-side-javascript-ebook/B00HSOCSCY/B00HSO6YD8">The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master</a></h2><p><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41oqLxoTYsL._SS130_.jpg" alt="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41oqLxoTYsL.SS130.jpg"/><h2 id="restful-web-apishttpskindleamazoncomworkrestful-web-apis-leonard-richardson-ebookb00dduvtr2b00f5bs966"><a href="https://kindle.amazon.com/work/restful-web-apis-leonard-richardson-ebook/B00DDUVTR2/B00F5BS966">RESTful Web APIs</a></h2><p><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51KhFuo-5%2BL._SS130_.jpg" alt="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51KhFuo-5%2BL.SS130.jpg"/></description><tags>php, angular.js, coder</tags></item></channel></rss>
