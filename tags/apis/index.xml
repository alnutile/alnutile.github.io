I am building and API to be used by an iOs and Android client I will be making soon. But I also needed the filter system to deal with my local Laravel view that was using the api via an Angular driven widget so the user can go to the website as well.
So the website is where the user can go to do change settings, subscription updates etc, but in that case they are logged in via the Laravel login form.</description></item><item><title>Github CLI to get Teams and Members of an Org</title><link>https://alfrednutile.info/posts/67/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alfrednutile.info/posts/67/</guid><description>Needed to make a quick library for pulling down this info and making it a CSV file.
