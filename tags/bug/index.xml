This is one reason. There is a space that purl is looking for a url starting with eg test. Some day you make a node test/testmore and decide later to use drupal&amp;#39;s redirect to save the url test/testmore and delete the node (or unpublish it) But since spaces and purl is keeping an eye on test it will not work.</description></item></channel></rss>
