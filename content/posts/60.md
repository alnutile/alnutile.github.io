In this case it is Laravel but any PHP framework could use this.

## Get the Library

I used the [dflydev-markdown](https://github.com/dflydev/dflydev-markdown) library which uses [php-markdown](http://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/) as it's base. [^1]

As it notes I load it up with composer.json and I am ready to use it.

## Inject the class into your controller

At the controller level I inject it like this

~~~
//BaseController.php

use dflydev\markdown\MarkdownExtraParser;

class BaseController {

    public $mk;

    public function __construct(MarkdownExtraParser $mk = null)
    {
        $this->mk       = ($mk == null) ? new MarkdownExtraParser() : $mk;
    }
~~~

Later on I call to it on both update and store on any of my Controllers that extend this class.

## Add a new field to your Posts or other content type 

But the other step here is to add a rendered_body field to my models/tables. Then on store and update I write to these but on edit I am working on the body field which is markdown.

~~~
$data['rendered_body']  = $this->mk->transformMarkdown($data['body']);
~~~ 

## Render it in the View

And in my Views I render the rendered_body field and NOT the body field which stores the raw text. This idea I got from [danneu.com](http://www.danneu.com/posts/9-rails-3-2-markdown-pygments-redcarpet-heroku/)

Now with the help of the docs on [php-markdown](http://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/) I can do most of the work I need to make a post, embed video, images etc. 

## Thoughts

As far as uploading **images** I use Dropbox for that so it is really not part of my needs. With dropbox I just take a snapshot and it auto uploads the image and I get the url in my clipboard. Though I then have to go to the URL and get the real URL. Still working on that.


[^1]: I may start using this [michelf](https://github.com/michelf/php-markdown) since the one I am using now is marked depreciated. But I have already made a change to this one so it works a little better with my settings. My fork is here [my fork](https://github.com/alnutile/dflydev-markdown) and my composer.json looks below [^2]
