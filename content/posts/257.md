BitBucket has a nice feature call Pipelines [https://bitbucket.org/product/features/pipelines](https://bitbucket.org/product/features/pipelines)  for $0 you can, even for private repos have a decent CI flow.

> Private repos CI Pipeline $0!!

It took a bit to get going though since the docs do not talk about PHP and MySQL in enough details. Here is what I ended up with for a `bitbucket-pipelines.yml`

```
# This is a sample build configuration for PHP.
# Check our guides at https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/e8YWN for more examples.
# Only use spaces to indent your .yml configuration.
# -----
# You can specify a custom docker image from Docker Hub as your build environment.
image: php:7.2

options:
  max-time: 120

pipelines:
  default:
    - step:
        caches:
          - composer
        script:
          - apt-get update && apt-get install -y unzip gnupg
          - docker-php-ext-install mysqli pdo pdo_mysql
          - curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php -- --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer
          - cp .env.bitbucket .env
          - curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | bash -
          #- apt-get install -y nodejs
          # hung on install so will have to come back to this
          #- npm install
          #- npm test
          - composer install
          - composer check-style
          - vendor/bin/phpunit
        services:
          - mysql
    - step:
        name: Deploy to staging
        image: aneitayang/aws-cli:1.0
        deployment: staging
        trigger: automatic
        script:
          - curl https://forge.laravel.com/servers/baz/sites/bar/deploy/http?token=foo

definitions:
  services:
    mysql:
      image: mysql:5.7
      environment:
        MYSQL_DATABASE: 'test'
        MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD: 'yes'
        MYSQL_USER: 'test_user'
        MYSQL_PASSWORD: 'password'
```

So basically I install mysql and set it up to use then all just work. NPM just hangs right now so I am not 100% sure what to do there.

## Debug
Unlike TravisCI I could not just SSH in to debug I had to run docker. 
Here are some links

  * https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/php-with-bitbucket-pipelines-873907835.html
  * [Config Info](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/configure-bitbucket-pipelines-yml-792298910.html)

running locally below worked for me

```
docker run -it --volume=$(pwd):/var/www/html --memory=4g --memory-swap=4g --memory-swappiness=0 --entrypoint=/bin/bash php:7.2-apache
```

But I would have to install their mysql docker as well they note and map them together. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯


Maybe the price is right for this vs TravisCI
