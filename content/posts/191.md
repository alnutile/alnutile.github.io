This is mostly a note2self.

Amazon Machine learning is one way to dig into things. For me it mean not getting bogged down in Python or tons of formulas for now.

Basically I watched their main video  [here](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/getting-started/) to get a view of how things worked.

Then I read their docs [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/latest/dg/what-is-amazon-machine-learning.html) and follow [this](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/latest/dg/tutorial.html) tutorial.

After that I took a moment to watch another video of how they used ML to help process messages from Twitter [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRRX9amYsyM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRRX9amYsyM)


From there I tried a few of my own datasets one I used on a not ready for prime time product [here](https://incomings.io/blogs/3)

Anyways it was just fun to play around. Their API is super easy to use, even to the point of having a PHP client I could plug in for AWS or MicroSoft [https://alfrednutile.info/projects/57](https://alfrednutile.info/projects/57)

Have a number of other ideas as well looking forward to making them happen here or with other services.
