The library is https://github.com/enygma/expose

>"Expose is an Intrusion Detection System for PHP loosely based on the PHPIDS project (and using it's ruleset for detecting potential threats)."

After seeing it in the latest PHPArch [magazine](https://www.phparch.com/2015/09/september-2015-issue-release-security-boot-camp/) on security I wanted to give it a try.

Of course this is far from a complete look.

Step 1 Make the MiddleWare

`php artisan make:middleware ExposeMiddleware`

Then add Expose as noted in the docs.

~~~
<?php

namespace App\Http\Middleware;

use Closure;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\App;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log;

class ExposeMiddleware
{
    public function handle($request, Closure $next)
    {
        $filters = new \Expose\FilterCollection();
        $filters->load();
        $logger = App::make('log');
        $manager = new \Expose\Manager($filters, $logger);
        $manager->run($request->input());

        Log::info(sprintf("Logging results from Expose %d", $manager->getImpact()));

        return $next($request);
    }
}

~~~

Then in `app/Http/Kernel.php`

~~~
    protected $middleware = [
        \Illuminate\Foundation\Http\Middleware\CheckForMaintenanceMode::class,
        \App\Http\Middleware\EncryptCookies::class,
        \Illuminate\Cookie\Middleware\AddQueuedCookiesToResponse::class,
        \Illuminate\Session\Middleware\StartSession::class,
        \Illuminate\View\Middleware\ShareErrorsFromSession::class,
        \App\Http\Middleware\ExposeMiddleware::class,
        \App\Http\Middleware\VerifyCsrfToken::class,
    ];

~~~

Now to make the route for testing

~~~
<?php


Route::get('/', function () {
    return view('welcome');
});

Route::post('/post', function() {

    return "Yo";
});
~~~

And now a phpunit test to hit the route

~~~
    public function testPost()
    {
        $token = csrf_token();
        $data = array(
                '_token' => $token,
                'test' => 'foo',
                'bar' => array(
                    'baz' => 'quux',
                    'testing' => '<script>test</script>'
                )
        );

        $this->call('POST', '/post', $data);
    }
~~~

One more thing is to set the `app/Http/Middleware/VerifyCsrfToken.php` as such

~~~

public function handle($request, Closure $next)
    {
        if ( 'testing' === App::environment() && $request->exists('_token') ) {
            $input = $request->all();
            $input['_token'] = $request->session()->token();
            $request->replace( $input );
        }

        if ($this->isReading($request) || $this->shouldPassThrough($request) || $this->tokensMatch($request)) {
            return $this->addCookieToResponse($request, $next($request));
        }

        throw new TokenMismatchException;
    }    
~~~

Okay so now we can tail the log file in the terminal and hit the route with phpunit

![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/fgoax2z12mhhf0t/expose.png?dl=0)

And the logs should output 

~~~
[2015-09-02 23:50:44] testing.INFO: Match found on Filter ID 38 [{"id":"38","rule":"(?:\\<[\\/]?(?:[i]?frame|applet|isindex|marquee|keygen|script|audio|video|input|button|textarea|style|base|body|meta|link|object|embed|param|plaintext|xm\\w+|image|im(?:g|port)))","description":"Detects possibly malicious html elements including some attributes","tags":"xss, csrf, id, rfe, lfi","impact":"4"}]
[2015-09-02 23:50:44] testing.INFO: Logging results from Expose 8

~~~


At this point the MiddleWare can do numerous things

  * Log to an in memory db IP addresses that violates a rule of a certain level and block them.
  * Keep track of issues and notify the team of issues
  * Cut through a can without getting dull
  

Anyways I have a ways to go with this but just seeing the different tools I could use to make my applications more secure.
