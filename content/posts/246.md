Just a note to self and others who have suffered this. If you are running queues locally, for what ever reason, then any changes you make in code you need to restart your queue daemon.

```
php artisan queue:restart
```

This will cause the daemon to look at a timestamp and restart if that is newer than before "e.g. you ran the above. And this will force the in memory process to update itself from the latest code base.

Good luck!
