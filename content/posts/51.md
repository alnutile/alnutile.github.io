<p>If you already have rvm install this should be easy. Otherwise google that pain.</p>

<p>I set my rvm to ruby 2.0 but not sure if needed</p>

<div class="code">
<p>rvm --default use 2.0</p>
</div>

<p><a href="http://rvm.io/rubies/default" target="_blank">http://rvm.io/rubies/default</a></p>

<p>Then I made a Gemfile in the root folder and add this content</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/alnutile/4ce81981e7bfe298de4e.js"></script>

<p>and run bundle install</p>

<p>After that was in place I ran guard init to get going and then pasted this code into the Guard file it made.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/alnutile/8831791.js"></script>

<p>So now my root folder has a guard file and it is looking for changes both in app/tests and app/* If the change happens in app/* other than tests it looks for the related *Test.php for that Controller or Model etc It also pops up a notification so you can see all is green or red as you work.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now you are finally ready to run guard&nbsp;</p>

<p>bundle exe guard&nbsp;</p>

<p>and that should start up guard</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
