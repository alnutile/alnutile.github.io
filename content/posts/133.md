This is all based around this library [https://github.com/lucadegasperi/oauth2-server-laravel](https://github.com/lucadegasperi/oauth2-server-laravel)

I am building and API to be used by an iOs and Android client I will be making soon. **But** I also needed the filter system to deal with my local Laravel view that was using the api via an Angular driven widget so the user can go to the website as well.

So the website is where the user can go to do change settings, subscription updates etc, but in that case they are logged in via the Laravel login form. From there they land on the profile page where the Angular widget will do n xhr request to the api to fill in the table/settings.

The routes ends up looking like this 

~~~

Route::filter('setUser', function()
{
	if(Auth::guest())
	{
		$user_id = Authorizer::getResourceOwnerId();
		Auth::loginUsingId($user_id);
	}
});

//The view they see using Laravel Blade and an embedded angular widget
Route::get('profile', ['middleware' => 'auth', 'uses' => 'ProfileController@getProfile']);

//The API
Route::group(['prefix' => 'api/v1', 'before' => 'oauth|setUser|auth'], function() {
	Route::get('profile',  'ProfileController@getApiProfile');
});
~~~

The thing is the Oauth2 filter was causing some issues

  1 Looks for a access_token query string or header
  2 Does not load the user like I need


The first issue I just made a class to extend the core filter for the Oauth2 library.

###  My provider 

~~~
<?php namespace App\Providers;

use App\Filters\OauthTotalRecalls;
use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;
class OauthFilterProvider extends ServiceProvider {
    public function boot()
    {
        $this->app->bindShared('LucaDegasperi\OAuth2Server\Filters\OAuthFilter', function ($app) {
            $httpHeadersOnly = $app['config']->get('oauth2.http_headers_only');
            return new OauthTotalRecalls($app['oauth2-server.authorizer'], $httpHeadersOnly);
        });
    }
    /**
     * Register the service provider.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function register()
    {
        // TODO: Implement register() method.
    }
}
~~~

Then I register that in my app.conf after I register his.

### My Filter

It overrides the filter to do one thing and that is to check if the user is a guest. Which they would not be if they are logging in via the Laravel login form.

~~~
<?php namespace App\Filters;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth;
use LucaDegasperi\OAuth2Server\Filters\OAuthFilter;
class OauthTotalRecalls extends OAuthFilter {
    /**
     * Run the oauth filter
     *
     * @internal param mixed $route, mixed $request, mixed $scope,...
     * @return void a bad response in case the request is invalid
     */
    public function filter()
    {
        if(Auth::guest())
        {
            if (func_num_args() > 2) {
                $args = func_get_args();
                $this->scopes = array_slice($args, 2);
            }
            $this->authorizer->validateAccessToken($this->httpHeadersOnly);
            $this->validateScopes();
        }
    }
}
~~~

### Loading user

So at this point the user is logged in via Laravel so the Auth::user() is fully set. But lastly if this was the token based log in the "setUser" filter will kick in and load the user from the token. If the token is wrong then this all will fail.

~~~
Route::filter('setUser', function()
{
	if(Auth::guest())
	{
		$user_id = Authorizer::getResourceOwnerId();
		Auth::loginUsingId($user_id);
	}
});
~~~
