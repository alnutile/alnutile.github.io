<p>I will not even try to write about this but instead share the most well written technical page I have read in a long time&nbsp;<a href="http://deeson-online.co.uk/labs/multi-processing-part-1-how-make-drush-rush" target="_blank">http://deeson-online.co.uk/labs/multi-processing-part-1-how-make-drush-rush</a></p>

<p>He covers how to make a drush command run multiple processes in parallel&nbsp;depending on how many threads you give it. I show in the image below me starting up the command to run 9 behat tests sent to Saucelabs with 4&nbsp;threads (could not go over that)</p>

<p>This reduced my testing time quite a bit for each cron job that runs these @critical tests.</p>

<p>Which is great. The next step will be to read up about the mtq where he integrates this in the DrupalQueue system!</p>

<p>now if only I had the Saucelabs account with unlimited threads!</p>

<p>Takes 10 seconds to start the jobs but this is &quot;normal&quot; for my behat to Saucelabs startup.</p>
