Working on learning [Dusk](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/dusk#introduction) and really excited to get going with it.

But running it in homestead proved to be a bit tricky.

After following the docs and running `php artisan dusk` not much happened. Sure if I ran it on my Mac and it just worked but my tests needed to do migrations and what not and I want to keep my work in Homestead.

So a few steps later and it worked thanks to this post [https://github.com/laravel/dusk/issues/50#issuecomment-275155974](https://github.com/laravel/dusk/issues/50#issuecomment-275155974)

## Local host file

Make sure to edit `sudo vim /etc/hosts` and add the APP_URL there as well

```
127.0.0.1 webforms.dev
```

Then make sure you can hit it from inside homestead as well.  

`curl -X GET http://webforms.dev`


All set?


## Then run xvfb

This is a virtual frame buffer that Chrome runs in. Pretty cool really [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xvfb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xvfb)

So I like to use screen to start a new session

`screen -S running_xvfb`

and then in there run

`Xvfb :0 -screen 0 1280x8000x24 &`

Now we want to swap back to our default session `CTRL+A` then still holding CTRL let go of A and press D.

You are back at your default terminal

Type:

```
vagrant@homestead:~/Code/webforms$ screen -ls
There is a screen on:
	16315.running_xvfb	(04/24/2017 12:34:09 AM)	(Detached)
1 Socket in /var/run/screen/S-vagrant.
```

Now it all just worked!
