Just to make this easy to find. I had a report to write which had numerous daily rows of the same related model data.
So in this cause I was tracking servers and security reports.

My reports where daily like this

| id        | server_id           | failed  | type |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:| ---|
|1|1|1| security |
|2|1|1| testing |
|3|1|0| testing |


But a groupBy here on server_id would return ID 1 so it would appear as if it was still failing.

Adding
```
$results = $results->whereRaw('ID IN ( select MAX(id) from reports GROUP BY server_id)');
```

or double group by:

```
$results = $results->whereRaw('ID IN ( select MAX(id) from reports GROUP BY server_id, type)');
```

Did the trick to sort and group by that latest record, which `latest` did not do for me.
