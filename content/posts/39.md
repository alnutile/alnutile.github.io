<p>&quot;failed to fetch from registry&quot;</p>

<p>But it was json endpoint was at that url so it was not a problem with the endpoint.</p>

<p>http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12913141/installing-from-npm-fails had a command that helped</p>

<blockquote>
<p>npm config set registry http://registry.npmjs.org/</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now it all worked.</p>
