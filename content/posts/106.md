I needed a way to run a bunch of jobs in parallel and I am use to using the Symfony Process Component for that. 

So this post will show how I did this in Laravel 4.3 via the Queue so I can remember next time.

What will come out of this is a workflow as seen here

We will create two Artisan Commands. This allows us to use Symfony Process to run numerous **console commands** in the background.

I will not go over how to add a job to the queue there is plenty on that. I will show the class I used for the Queue and it's attributes.

~~~
{
    "job":"Foo\\\\Reporting\\\\RequestsCommandQueueRunner",
    "data":{
        "results_uuid":"4a13aaee-4289-4f95-afe5-ea5abaaed869"
    }
}
~~~

This gets pushed into the Queue. It is the "Parent" that will run x number of children commands. The x is defined in my .env.local.php or .env.production.php files. This way I can increase or decrease the number of threads it will run as needed.

The results_uuid is the data I need to get the children. In this case the children have that uuid in their table as belongsTo that parent.


## RequestsCommandQueueRunner

This Artisan command is quite simple 

~~~
<?php

#app/Foo/RequestsCommandQueueRunner.php

namespace Foo\Reporting;


use Foo\Models\ReportingOverviewBatchRequestJob;
use Foo\QueueServices\QueueInterface;

class RequestsCommandQueueRunner implements QueueInterface {


    protected $job_limit;
    protected $results_uuid;

    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->job_limit = $_ENV['RESULTS_QUEUE_LIMIT'];
    }

    public function fire($job, $params)
    {
        $this->results_uuid = $params['results_uuid'];
        exec("php artisan request:trigger $this->results_uuid", $results);
        $job->delete(); //@TODO make delete if all goes well catch error though and fail it
    }
}
~~~

All it does is passes the parent id to the trigger command. Below is the trigger command.

Note too I am not using the job limit yet. Later I will make x number of Queue jobs as I divide the number of children that parent has by the limit set.

## RequestsQueueCommand

~~~
<?php namespace Foo\Console;

#app/Foo/Console/RequestsQueueCommand.php

use Foo\Models\ReportingOverviewBatchRequestJob;
use Illuminate\Console\Command;
use Symfony\Component\Console\Input\InputOption;
use Symfony\Component\Console\Input\InputArgument;
use Symfony\Component\Process\Process;

class RequestsQueueCommand extends Command {

	protected $name = 'request:trigger';
	protected $run  = [];

	protected $description = 'Trigger the running of related jobs';
    protected $request_uuid;
    protected $projects;    
    /**
     * @var \Foo\Models\ReportingOverviewBatchRequestJob
     */
    private $reporting_overview_batch_request_jobs;

    public function __construct(
        ReportingOverviewBatchRequestJob $reporting_overview_batch_request_jobs
        )
	{
		parent::__construct();
        $this->reporting_overview_batch_request_jobs = $reporting_overview_batch_request_jobs;
    }

    public function fire()
	{
        $this->request_uuid = $this->argument('request_uuid');
        $this->setRelatedProjects();
        $this->setRun();
        $this->runRelatedProjectsCommand();

		return "Fired";
	}

	protected function getArguments()
	{
		return array(
			array('request_uuid', InputArgument::REQUIRED, 'The uuid of the Request to trigger the jobs for'),
		);
	}

    protected function setRelatedProjects()
    {
        $projects =
            $this->reporting_overview_batch_request_jobs->getAllJobsForReportOverviewBatchRequestUuid($this->request_uuid);
        $this->projects = $projects->toArray();
        return $this->projects;
    }

    protected function setRun()
    {
        foreach($this->projects as $project)
        {
            $this->addToRun($project['id']);
        }
    }

    protected function runRelatedProjectsCommand()
    {
        foreach($this->run as $process)
        {
            $process->start();
        }

        while(count($this->run) > 0)
        {
            foreach($this->run as $key => $process)
            {
                if(!$process->isRunning())
                {
                    \Log::info("Done running process");
                    unset($this->run[$key]);
                }
            }
        }

    }

    protected function addToRun($project_id)
    {
        $this->run[] = new Process("php artisan request:run $project_id");
    }
}

Here is where things get interesting. I begin the work of finding the children Ids then making an array of **console commands** to run using the children id as the argument I pass. 

The Process Component allows me to **start them in the background** and then check on them while they are running.

Now for the command it runs "php artisan request:run $project_id"

## RequestsJobRunCommand

This is the process that does the long running work. In this case logs into Github, get some info and reports on it.

There still is some work to do. I have to set the limit so my initial run does not timeout. I also need to clean up some code so that these classes are digging so deep into the other classes. 

But this was just to show how to use Symfony Process Component, Laravel Queue, and Laravel Artisan to run a multi threaded task.
