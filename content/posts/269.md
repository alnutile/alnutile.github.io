I do a lot with fixtures when testing. This means I put files in the `tests/fixtures` folder that represet the JSON of what ever I am testing. For example maybe I hit an
API that returns

```json
{
 "foo": "bar"
}
```

And when I mock that API response I want to have that ready for me to use.

I then save it to the folder `tests/fixtures/foo.json` and can just use it. 

To do that I just do the following. 

## Setup a helpers.php file in your app

Add the file `app/helpers.php` for now with `<?php` on top of it.

```
<?php
```
Not to exciting yet!

Then add it to `composer.json`

```
File: composer.json
38:     "autoload-dev": {
39:         "psr-4": {
40:             "Tests\\": "tests/"
41:         },
42:         "files": [
43:             "app/helpers.php"
44:         ]
45:     },
```

Now run `composer dump` and you are ready to add helpers to your app.


## Add get and put helpers

To that file I add the getter and putter(?):

```
<?php 

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\File;

if (!function_exists("put_fixture")) {
    function put_fixture($file_name, $content = [], $json = true)
    {
        if ($json) {
            $content = json_encode($content, 128);
        }
        File::put(
            base_path(sprintf("tests/fixtures/%s", $file_name)),
            $content
        );
        return true;
    }
}

if (!function_exists("get_fixture")) {
    function get_fixture($file_name)
    {
        $results = File::get(base_path(sprintf(
            "tests/fixtures/%s",
            $file_name
        )));
        return json_decode($results, true);
    }
}
```

and I make the folder `tests/fixtures`

And now in my tests I can do this:

```        
put_fixture('meta_data.json', $response_from_api_as_array);
```

>NOTE: Many apis have good docs that sometimes show a JSON response I can save. But somtimes I want a real response to save it so I hit the api ONCE from my test
>and mock it from then on

and I can use that later just like this

```        
get_fixture('meta_data.json', $response_from_api_as_array);
```

This will simply put a file and get that file `tests/fixtures/meta_data.json`

And the file will be JSON for example:

```json
{
 "foo": "bar"
}
```
