I can be really annoying to troubleshoot a failed test in Dusk when using CI systems. What I ended up doing was setting up my project to send these files to S3 on fail.

Here are the steps

## Setup You App

This is just S3 storage so make sure you have a bucket and a folder in the bucket to write to. Basically for AWS you make an IAM with a key and secret and let it read/write to this folder. Might look like this policy

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow"
        },
        {
            "Action": [
                "*"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket/*"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow"
        }
    ]
}
```

or limited it just to the folder `screenshots`

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
                "s3:HeadBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": "*",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Sid": "VisualEditor1"
        },
        {
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:GetBucketLocation"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket",
                "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket/*"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0"
        },
        {
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket/screenshots",
                "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket/screenshots/*"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Sid": "VisualEditor2"
        }
    ]
}
```

Now in your `tests/DuskTestCase.php` file add this:

```
    public function tearDown()
    {
        if (env("TRAVIS")) {
        $files = \File::files(base_path("tests/Browser/screenshots"));

        if ($files) {
            foreach ($files as $file) {
                Storage::disk('travis_fails')
                    ->put($file->getFileName(), $file->getContents());
            }
        }
        }
        parent::tearDown();
    }
```

This will run on Travis based tests saving files to the bucket.

I added to my `config/filesystems.php` file this:

```
    'disks' => [
        'travis_fails' => [
            'driver' => 's3',
            'key' => env('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'),
            'secret' => env('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'),
            'region' => "eu-west-1",
            'root' => "screenshots",
            'bucket' => 'foo-bucket',
            'url' => env('AWS_URL'),
        ],
				/// 
```

Now for TravisCI


## Setup TravisCI

Then in Travis under Settings -> Environment Variables we make sure to add our key and secret with the proper key format:

```
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=foo
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=bar
```

## Now You are Ready to Fail!

Ok so on your next fail you will see in your s3 bucket some of those super handy screenshots.
