Basically the site went from foo-prod.stagingarea.us to wearelive.com but since it was an internal app I wanted to make sure the old url still worked and redirected as needed to the new url

~~~
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name foo-prod.stagingarea.us;
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}

server {
        listen 443;
        server_name foo-prod.stagingarea.us;
        if ($host ~* ^foo-prod.stagingarea.us) {
          rewrite ^(.*)$ https://wearelive.com$1 permanent;
        }
~~~

Interesting note is server_name does not contain the primary name wearlive.com
