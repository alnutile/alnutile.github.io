I wrote an article on Mailcatcher and Homestead [here](http://www.alfrednutile.info/posts/93) but as I move into docker I wanted the same setup for my docker website container which was super easy.

First I downloaded this [docker images](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/schickling/mailcatcher/) and ran the command as he noted. Once done I had the website up and running.

![mailcatcher_docker](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/w1mxwcw8129raxg/docker_behat.png?dl=0)

From there I just started my website container and made a link.

~~~
docker run -d -p 80:80 --name website --link mailcatcher:mailcatcher -v $PWD:/share alnutile/nginxlaravel:0.3.4 /sbin/my_init
~~~


From there I was able to use the server set environments to connect to it as needed. Or more simply I just updated my local/mail.php as follows

~~~
<?php

return array(

	'driver' => 'smtp',

	'host' => getenv('MAILCATCHER_PORT_1080_TCP_ADDR'),

	'port' => 1025,

	'from' => array('address' => 'foobar@gmail.com', 'name' => 'Behat Editor Admin'),

	'encryption' => '',

	'username' => null,

	'password' => null,

	'pretend' => false,

);

~~~

Now I get to see the email as a user would see it and click around as needed!
