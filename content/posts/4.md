<p>When doing some API work using Laravel as the REST server I was getting a common error &quot;No &#39;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&#39; header is present on the requested resource.&quot; which happens when the REST server is on a different domain than the client server.</p>

<p>I installed this package&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-cors" target="_blank">https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-cors</a>&nbsp;and it now works fine.</p>
