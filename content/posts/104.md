There are a number of related models to this one model that I store in the Models $relations property

~~~
    protected static $relations = [
        'owner',
        'apns',
        'zoning_urls',
        'structures.address',
        'structures.comments.user.profiles',
        'listings',
        'attachments',
        'structures.structure_type',
        'property_owner',
        'primary_property_type',
        'address',
        'property_specialist.profiles',
        'listings.team'
    ];
~~~

This allows me to easily reuse this for each query

~~~
$found = $found->load(static::$relations);
~~~

But there is one model I removed from that list to do a dynamic query/sorting on it

~~~
        $found = $this->property->with([
            'verifiers' => function($query) {
                    $query->with('user.profiles')->orderBy('id', 'DESC');
                },
        ])->findOrFail($id);
        $found = $found->load(static::$relations);
~~~

veifiers was part of the protected static $relations list but I moved it out since, for each query, I need to sort them from last to first.
