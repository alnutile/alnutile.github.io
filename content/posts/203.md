Just the start to a new library that I hope others will help out on [https://github.com/alfred-nutile-inc/larscanner](https://github.com/alfred-nutile-inc/larscanner)

There is a roadmap in the readme.md but basically how to start adding more and more features on this to protect our applications built in Laravel.
