<p>Scratched my head on this one for a few.</p>

<p>Inside of ng-if is a new scope. So a model on $scope.modelName will have to be referenced as $parent.modelName in the view.</p>

<p>Basically it worked on another page so I knew it should work here. When I moved it out of ng-if it worked so it had to be related to that. Finally this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18342917/angularjs-ng-model-doesnt-work-inside-ng-if" target="_blank">post</a> made some sense of it</p>

<p>So now my filter works.</p>
