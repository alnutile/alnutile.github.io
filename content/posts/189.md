make the username and password  [http://www.htaccesstools.com/htpasswd-generator/](http://www.htaccesstools.com/htpasswd-generator/)

```
admin:$apr1$wLiZDI74$/D64sfIdn74kHc6F.76Qv/
```

And save it in a file called, for example, `htpass`

Now `scp -v htpass forge@your_server:~/`

Go to forge and find the site and click "Edit Nginx Configuration"

Now in there just add these lines 

```
        auth_basic            "Restricted Area";
        auth_basic_user_file  /home/forge/htpass;
```

As seen below

I think that will restart/reload Nginx, if does not go to the page that list your "Server Details" and restart there
