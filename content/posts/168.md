**Original Post** [http://laravel-tricks.com/tricks/session-timeout-for-logged-in-user](http://laravel-tricks.com/tricks/session-timeout-for-logged-in-user)

This Middleware made it super easy to satisfy a requirement to log the user out after 15 minutes of in activity.

I added only a few touchups.

One was the `getTimeOut` this was so I can work locally and override this by setting it to a large number.  I could even use it to just bypass the whole things for a bit since on `local` I rather not deal with this. 

Also I removed the message count since it just was not needed for what I was doing.

            Auth::logout();
            return redirect('auth/login')->withErrors(['You had not activity in 15 minutes']);
