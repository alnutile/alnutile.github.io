The creator of Angular notes it in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhfUv0spHCY&list=FLZa3QWzy1z1G9FIw02pytdA&index=2) which is well worth the watch.

Basically when using includes or directives etc you may not be getting a scope value as easily because it is child scope and you may be looking in the parent scope. 

### For example 

This include if I have an include and it references a model attribute like this

~~~
//Some include
<input ng-model="firstname">
~~~

I may not get the results from that input that I expect. I may not get any. So to be safe it is best to make an Object for your data that then has keys to get the value from. For example

~~~
//Some controller
$scope.person = {};
$scope.person.firstname = "Bob"
~~~

Then back in that include

~~~
//Some include
<input ng-model="person.firstname">
~~~

Tends to work better than fighting with $parent prefixes as such

~~~
//Some include
<input ng-model="$parent.firstname">
~~~

Anyways glad I watched the video which meant I only wasted under an hour one this head scratcher.
