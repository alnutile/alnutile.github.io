I am doing some queue work and wanted beanstalkd console installed so I can see the status of the queue

![beanstalkd_console](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/1465416717c26b64eb6bc2647a2e8def90ee6da0/68747470733a2f2f7261772e6769746875622e636f6d2f7074726f66696d6f762f6265616e7374616c6b5f636f6e736f6c652f6d61737465722f636f7665722f6274636f6e736f6c652e706e67)

Using Laravel Homestead as the vagrant box http://laravel.com/docs/homestead I needed to 

  * Download beanstalkd console https://github.com/ptrofimov/beanstalk_console
  * Setup Homesteads yml file
  * Provision the box
  * Setup my local hosts file to a url
  * Finally run php artisan queue:listen to have my app call to the queue.

And that was about it.

### Download Beanstalkd Console

https://github.com/ptrofimov/beanstalk_console
have it stored in the

~~~
/home/vagrant/Code/
vagrant@homestead:~/Code/
~~~

### Homestead YML file

~~~
//Homestead.yaml in root of your Homestead Vagrant install 
sites:
    - map: beanstalkd.dev
      to: /home/vagrant/Code/beanstalk_console/public
~~~

### Provision the new site

With Vagrant running do 

~~~
#on my local box not in vagrant
> vagrant provision
~~~

### Host file

Just make sure to match 127.0.0.1 to what the domain above or what ever you want

~~~
#/etc/hosts
127.0.0.1 beanstalkd.dev
~~~

Then in the vagrant box make sure beanstalkd is running ideally every time you start the box. Which by default the box does this.


Finally you should be able to go to http://beanstalkd.dev:8000/
and see

### Queue Listen

~~~
#folder of project
php artisan queue:listen
~~~


Now as you put things in the queue you can see them come and go at http://beanstalkd.dev:8000/
