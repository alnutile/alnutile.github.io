Just a note2self really.

Setting up Auth was super easy

As seen below I had to add to my serverless.yml `authorizer`

```
  addQuote:
    handler: quote/handler.add
    events:
      - http:
          path: quote
          method: post
          cors: true
          authorizer: aws_iam
```

**authorizer: aws_iam**

From here I then needed, in this case Postman, to pass an AWS KEY and SECRET made for this app.

When making the user I attached this Policy to the user

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "execute-api:Invoke"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:execute-api:us-east-1:AWS_ID:*/dev/POST/quote"
        }
    ]
}
```

I an easily make this in the `serverless.yml` file by adding the following:

```

resources:
  Resources:
    s3Data:
      Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
      Properties:
        BucketName: "${self:custom.bucket}"
        VersioningConfiguration:
          Status: Enabled
    quotePolicy:
      Type: AWS::IAM::Policy
      Properties:
        PolicyName: "serverless-quotes-policy-${opt:stage, self:provider.stage}"
        PolicyDocument:
          Version: "2012-10-17"
          Statement:
            -
              Effect: "Allow"
              Action:
                - "execute-api:Invoke"
              Resource: "arn:aws:execute-api:#{AWS::Region}:#{AWS::AccountId}:*/${opt:stage, self:provider.stage}/POST/quote"
        Users:
          - "serverless-quotes-${opt:stage, self:provider.stage}"
      DependsOn:
        - authUser
    userKey:
      Type: AWS::IAM::AccessKey
      Properties:
        UserName: "serverless-quotes-${opt:stage, self:provider.stage}"
      DependsOn:
        - authUser
    authUser:
      Type: AWS::IAM::User
      Properties:
        UserName: "serverless-quotes-${opt:stage, self:provider.stage}"

  Outputs:
      UserSecret:
        Description: The user secret
        Value:
          "Fn::GetAtt": [ userKey, SecretAccessKey ]
      UserKey:
        Description: The user key
        Value:
          "Ref": userKey
```

This is after adding `serverless-pseudo-parameters` plugin, see link below.

Now when I run `sls deploy --stage dev` I get the User, IAM, Key and Secret (via the webui output), then I need to access this url.

That was it. With serverless.com I could have limited stage, production builds to the unique user per stack as well.
