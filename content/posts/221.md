By default I set my `phpunit.xml` to use `test` as my database:

```
    <php>
        <env name="APP_ENV" value="testing"/>
        <env name="CACHE_DRIVER" value="array"/>
        <env name="SESSION_DRIVER" value="array"/>
        <env name="MAIL_DRIVER" value="log"/>
        <env name="QUEUE_DRIVER" value="sync"/>
        <env name="DB_DATABASE" value="test"/> <-- this line here 
    </php>
```

But with [Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/valet) and [Dusk](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/dusk) this led to the browser using my default database and not `test`
but the PHPUnit test itself was using `test` so the user I created and logged in as was not available in the browser.

I tried to set `.env.dusk.local` and I tried `phpuni.dusk.xml` none of it worked so I had to remove `<env name="DB_DATABASE" value="test"/>`

This is a bummer and I am sure I am missing something. What this means and my tests reset my database for my local app which ideally it would not since it is really nice to keep state.
