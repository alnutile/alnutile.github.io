Just had to tackle this issue so making some notes for later here :)

**Updated and more detailed [here](https://alfrednutile.info/posts/188)**

I run selenium on my Windows PC and before that my Mac, either one would have had this issue since my test is running side my VM. This meant when I needed to run a test to interact with a form to upload an image that image path was relative to the machine (VM) that I started the test on and not the Browser that was being manipulated by Selenium2.

The solution was "easy" thanks to this [thread](https://github.com/minkphp/MinkSelenium2Driver/issues/187#issuecomment-112106857) 

After that my step just looked like this and I was done

~~~
    /**
     * @Then I should be able to upload an image file
     */
    public function iShouldBeAbleToUploadAnImageFile()
    {
        $localFile = base_path('features/assets/profile.jpg');
        $tempZip = tempnam('', 'WebDriverZip');
        $zip = new \ZipArchive();
        $zip->open($tempZip, \ZipArchive::CREATE);
        $zip->addFile($localFile, basename($localFile));
        $zip->close();

        $remotePath = $this->getSession()->getDriver()->getWebDriverSession()->file([
            'file' => base64_encode(file_get_contents($tempZip))
        ]);

        $this->attachFileToField('profile_image', $remotePath);

        unlink($tempZip);
        
        $this->pressButton('Save');
    }
~~~

I also had to add `@javascript` to the test to allow this WebDriver feature to work.

That was it, saved me a ton of time suffering through this gotcha moment.
