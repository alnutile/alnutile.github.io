This article made it clear how to set this up<br><a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/paperclip-s3" target="" rel="">https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/paperclip-s3</a><br><br>And this one made it clear why my development environment was not working.<br><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11760597/s3-paperclip-working-on-heroku-but-not-localhost" target="" rel="">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11760597/s3-paperclip-working-on-heroku-but-not-localhost</a><br>I had to edit my .bash_profile<br>But instead of restarting the terminal I just did&nbsp;<br><br>source ~/.bash_profile&nbsp;<br><br>and then started that rails server again<b> in that terminal.</b><br><br>If only I found a tutorial on using fog and paperclip since I am already using that gem for refinerycms<br><br>
