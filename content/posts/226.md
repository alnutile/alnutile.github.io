I have been using PostMark for years [https://postmarkapp.com](https://postmarkapp.com)
for sending emails, e.g. password reset and more.

They have an API but to get going with SMTP all the info is [here](https://postmarkapp.com/developer/user-guide/sending-email/sending-with-smtp)

Basically get your KEY and use it in your .env like this:

```
MAIL_DRIVER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=smtp.postmarkapp.com
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=foo
MAIL_PASSWORD=foo
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
```

And all should work. Just make sure to 

  * Register the domain in their domain ui 
  * Set the from info in Laravel
