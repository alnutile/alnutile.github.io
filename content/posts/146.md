Wow, writing [Artisan Commands](http://laravel.com/docs/master/artisan#command-structure) just become even easier. And plugging it into [Scheduler](http://laravel.com/docs/master/scheduling) makes for a great combination.

For example we need to clean out a folder every so many minutes. The example below I also for fun play around with `progress` and table output.

Note too `protected $signature    = 'approve:cleanuploads {--minutes=10}';` simplifies the`argument` and `options` features.

~~~
<?php namespace App\Console\Commands;

use Carbon\Carbon;
use Illuminate\Console\Command;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\File;

class CleanUploadsCommands extends Command
{
    protected $rootPath     = 'public/storage';
    protected $maxMinutes   = 10;
    protected $deleted      = [];
    protected $signature    = 'approve:cleanuploads {--minutes=10}';
    protected $description  = 'Clean all the uploads in the storage folder for security reasons';
    protected $pdfFiles     = [];
    protected $files        = [];

    public function __construct()
    {
        parent::__construct();
    }

    public function handle()
    {
        $this->maxMinutes = $this->option('minutes');
        $this->anyPdfFilesHere();
        $this->deletePdfFiles();
        $this->outputResults();
    }

    protected function anyPdfFilesHere()
    {
        $this->files = File::allFiles(base_path($this->rootPath));

        foreach($this->files as $file)
        {
            if (File::mimeType($file) == 'application/pdf')
            {
                $this->pdfFiles[] = $file;
            }
        }
    }

    private function deletePdfFiles()
    {
        if(count($this->pdfFiles) > 0)
        {
            $this->output->progressStart(count($this->pdfFiles));

            foreach($this->pdfFiles as $file)
            {
                $modified = File::lastModified($file);

                $minutes = Carbon::createFromTimestamp($modified)->diffInMinutes();

                if($minutes > $this->maxMinutes)
                {
                    $this->setDeleted(['filename' => $file]);
                    File::delete($file);
                    $this->output->progressAdvance();
                }
            }
        }
    }

    private function outputResults()
    {
        if(count($this->deleted) > 0)
        {
            $this->output->progressFinish();
            $headers = ['File Name and Path'];
            $this->table($headers, $this->getDeleted());
        }
        else
        {
            $this->comment(sprintf("No files older than %d minutes", $this->maxMinutes));
        }
    }

    public function getDeleted()
    {
        return $this->deleted;
    }

    public function setDeleted($deleted)
    {
        $this->deleted[] = $deleted;
    }


}
~~~

Then in the Kernel.php I enter 

~~~
<?php namespace Approve\Console;


use Illuminate\Console\Scheduling\Schedule;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Console\Kernel as ConsoleKernel;

class Kernel extends ConsoleKernel
{
    /**
     * The Artisan commands provided by your application.
     *
     * @var array
     */
    protected $commands = [
		'App\Console\Commands\CleanUploadsCommands'
    ];

    /**
     * Define the application's command schedule.
     *
     * @param  \Illuminate\Console\Scheduling\Schedule  $schedule
     * @return void
     */
    protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
    {
        $schedule->command('approve:cleanuploads --minutes=10')
                 ->everyMinute();
    }
}

~~~

And that is it.

One big thing about Commands is the power of Asynchronous processing that libraries like [Symfony Process](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/process.html) gives us the ability to run numerous commands at once!
