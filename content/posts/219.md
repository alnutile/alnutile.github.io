This all comes down to me using [https://github.com/orchestral/testbench](https://github.com/orchestral/testbench)

With this in place I can work on an external library as if it is in Laravel.

The one place I ran into trouble on though was mocking model related methods like `all` for example a model `Foo` being called as `\App\Foo::all()` was hard to mock cause all is stacic:


```
//\Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model::all
    public static function all($columns = ['*'])
    {
        return (new static)->newQuery()->get(
            is_array($columns) ? $columns : func_get_args()
        );
    }
```

But once I did this to my test:

```
    public function testGetWithNoResults()
    {
        $mock = \Mockery::mock("alias:AlfredNutileInc\LaravelFeatureFlags\FeatureFlag");
        $mock->shouldReceive('all')->once()->andReturn([]);

        App::instance(FeatureFlag::class, $mock);

        $fjs = new FeatureFlagsForJavascript();

        $this->assertEmpty($fjs->get());
    }
```

It was mocked!
