A colleague of mine [Dave Hall](https://twitter.com/skwashd) poing out [IronFunctions](https://github.com/iron-io/functions). And being in the pursuit of serverless options especially ones that even have examples of PHP I had to give it a try.  This post is a note2self in that the intro [here](https://github.com/iron-io/functions/tree/master/examples/hello/php) has some bits that need fixing BUT I think it is close and I hope to add more updates here about the tool.

All the steps below will only work once you take on the initial hello world [here](https://github.com/iron-io/functions/blob/master/README.md). After that you have the `fn` cli tool installed and a running local iron-functions server.

For one I needed to apply each patch seen [here](https://github.com/iron-io/functions/pull/444/files)

Once I had all that in place I re-reran the `fn` install command from the folder where I download the `iron-io/functions` repo into 

```
cd ../functions
curl -LSs https://goo.gl/VZrL8t | sh
```

Then I restarted the service

```
docker run --rm -it --name functions -v ${PWD}/data:/app/data -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -p 8080:8080 iron/functions
```

>btw you need to have Docker working on your machine. This is so easy now that, for example [mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/), it should be a gui install.

Ok now back to my example project

```
cd ../example_php
```

In here I have several files since the above fix

```
worker.php
func.yml
Dockerfile
```

>the cat hello.payload.php in the example docs did not work so I used curl and POST instead but this is not what I want to do
>I want to test this from the CLI first so will come back to that later

This folder has a `composer.json` file. Just run `composer init` since it just needs to be a basic install of PHP.

**worker.php**
```
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
stream_set_blocking(STDIN, 0);
$payload = json_decode(file_get_contents("php://stdin"), true);
if (isset($payload['name'])) {
    var_dump($payload);
    echo "Hello 2 ", $payload['name'],"!\n\n";
} else {
    var_dump($payload);
    echo "Hello World 2!\n\n";
}
```

**func.yml**
```
name: alnutile/hello
version: 0.0.7
runtime: php
entrypoint: ./func
build:
- docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/worker -w /worker iron/php:dev composer install
```

**Dockerfile**
```
FROM iron/php

WORKDIR /app
ADD . /app

ENTRYPOINT ["php", "worker.php"]
```

Then as the docs note [https://github.com/iron-io/functions/tree/master/examples/hello/php](https://github.com/iron-io/functions/tree/master/examples/hello/php) I do all the install steps.

Once those are done ran `curl` to see it work:

    >curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/r/phpapp1/hello -d '{ "name": "bar" }'


Which results in:

```
array(1) {
  ["name"]=>
  string(3) "bar"
}
Hello 2 bar!
```

For updates I added one more file `update.sh`

```
#!/bin/sh
# update a function with a new version and push it
fn bump && fn build && fn push
# then update the route
fn routes update phpapp1 /hello
```

just to save some time there.


More soon on using this with Lumen and other options. I tried this but some PHP items are missing on the Alpine docker image to make this work.
