## Update October 10 10:07

Have hit a few issues with this model but still working okay.

To start this trait does some of the work to manage incoming POST data.


~~~
<?php namespace BehatEditor\Helpers;

use Rhumsaa\Uuid\Uuid;

trait UuidHelper {

    protected $uuid;
    protected $saved;

    public function getUuid()
    {
        return $this->uuid;
    }

    public function setUuid($uuid = null)
    {
        if($uuid === null)
        {
            $uuid = $this->generateNewId()->toString();
        }
        $this->uuid = $uuid;
        return $this;
    }

    /**
     * Get a new version 4 (random) UUID.
     *
     * @return \Rhumsaa\Uuid\Uuid
     */
    public function generateNewId()
    {
        return Uuid::uuid4();
    }

    protected function setModelParamsIdWithUuid($params)
    {
        if(!isset($params['id'])) {
            $this->setUuid($this->generateNewId()->toString());
            $params['id'] = $this->getUuid();
        }
        $this->uuid = $params['id'];
        return $params;
    }

    public function dealWithUsingUuidNotReturningIdFromCreate($model)
    {
        $this->saved = $model->find($this->uuid);
    }
} 
~~~

Here is an example of me using it.


~~~

   /**
    * Incoming Post request from the Controller to a Service and finally to this Repository Class.
   */
    public function createNewBatch($batch) 
    {
    	try {

    	    $this->post = $batch; //Incoming post data
    		
            $this->setRelatedObjectsFromPost(); //I deal with some of the related data or incoming data before hand

            $setUuid = $this->setModelParamsIdWithUuid($batch); //this is the traits setting the UUID on the incoming POST data.

            $this->batch->create($setUuid); //Finally I create using the auto-generated UUID OR the id/uuid that came in via the post

            /**
             * Again the trait takes care of this ONE issue I can not get around is returning the results of Create with the an ID
             * It works and saves the data but the ID is missing. Though looking at Eloquent this most likely is because I need to be using save.
             * Any ways I load it back up again for further processing.
             * Also some of this work started when I was using Eloquent outside of Laravel so it may need to be refactored since we are back in Laravel.
            */
            $this->dealWithUsingUuidNotReturningIdFromCreate($this->batch); 

            $this->extractAndSyncRelatedObjects(); //This is the further processing I do not really related to this post

            return $this->uuid; //This was set in the Trait see the trait class for this uuid field.
    	} catch (\Exception $e) {
    		throw new \Exception('The batch could not be created ' . $e->getMessage());
    	}
    }

~~~

Also note the model class needs this property set

~~~
public $incrementing = false;

## END UPDATES

I needed to have UUID setup for users since we will be syncing users from site to site. I also wanted to use sentry as a starting point for user auth, roles and groups.

Using this starter package for a demo [https://github.com/alnutile/L4withSentry/tree/uuid](https://github.com/alnutile/L4withSentry/tree/uuid) which is a fork of [https://github.com/rydurham/L4withSentry](https://github.com/rydurham/L4withSentry)

A lot of this comes from [http://garrettstjohn.com/entry/using-uuids-laravel-eloquent-orm/](http://garrettstjohn.com/entry/using-uuids-laravel-eloquent-orm/)

[The repo will show the changes](https://github.com/alnutile/L4withSentry/commit/8584933cda24e4101ed96cd5c3e8547b8fe249ba)


## [Add the method and class to the base controller](https://github.com/alnutile/L4withSentry/commit/8584933cda24e4101ed96cd5c3e8547b8fe249ba#diff-672d7136f99d93d53f1316b3fc946826R3)

This way we can call to it from other controllers as needed

##[Update the UserController](https://github.com/alnutile/L4withSentry/commit/8584933cda24e4101ed96cd5c3e8547b8fe249ba#diff-0ad2286fb1ab9c8b1ec84d26853bf8f1L117)

There are lots of changes in here to replace is_numeric wtih $this->isValue($id) to check the uuid

##[Update the seeder](https://github.com/alnutile/L4withSentry/commit/8584933cda24e4101ed96cd5c3e8547b8fe249ba#diff-31ad8f46f16744031d2d9092c100ffc1R3)

This will setup our seed data to work as well

##[Update the user model](https://github.com/alnutile/L4withSentry/commit/8584933cda24e4101ed96cd5c3e8547b8fe249ba#diff-b7b60617536fe5447b0ab052b1878990R5)

We call the boot method to generate a uuid if there is none being passed in.


## Update October 10 10:18

This below setup for the model has not worked which is why I have the update at the start of this article

## End update

~~~
/**
     * The "booting" method of the model.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public static function boot()
    {
        parent::boot();

        /**
         * Attach to the 'creating' Model Event to provide a UUID
         * for the `id` field (provided by $model->getKeyName())
         */
        static::creating(function ($model) {
            $model->id = (string)$model->generateNewId();
        });
    }
~~~

and then generateNewId method down below

~~~
   /**
     * Get a new version 4 (random) UUID.
     *
     * @return \Rhumsaa\Uuid\Uuid
     */
    public function generateNewId()
    {
        return Uuid::uuid4();
    }
~~~


##[Update Route file](https://github.com/alnutile/L4withSentry/commit/8584933cda24e4101ed96cd5c3e8547b8fe249ba#diff-4a87548edb6f75cbf33358b912d43775L22)

Replace the regular expressions to allow uuid

~~~
+Route::get('users/{id}/reset/{code}', 'UserController@reset')->where('id', '[a-z0-9\-]+');
  Route::get('users/{id}/suspend', array('as' => 'suspendUserForm', function($id)
  {
  	return View::make('users.suspend')->with('id', $id);
  }));
~~~

There are a number of them in there

##[Composer](https://github.com/alnutile/L4withSentry/commit/8584933cda24e4101ed96cd5c3e8547b8fe249ba#diff-b5d0ee8c97c7abd7e3fa29b9a27d1780R5)

Of course you need it in your composer file

~~~
	"require": {
		"laravel/framework": "4.2.*",
		"cartalyst/sentry": "~2.1",
        "r15ch13/peculiar": "1.0.*@dev"
	},
~~~

##User Migration file

This repo the sentry migration files are copied into app/database/migrations

This being key 

~~~
$table->string('id', '36')->primary();
~~~

~~~
#app/database/migrations/2012_12_06_225921_migration_cartalyst_sentry_install_users.php

<?php

use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration;

class MigrationCartalystSentryInstallUsers extends Migration {

	/**
	 * Run the migrations.
	 *
	 * @return void
	 */
	public function up()
	{
		Schema::create('users', function($table)
		{
                        $table->string('id', '36')->primary();
			$table->string('email');
			$table->string('password');
			$table->text('permissions')->nullable();
			$table->boolean('activated')->default(0);
			$table->string('activation_code')->nullable();
			$table->timestamp('activated_at')->nullable();
			$table->timestamp('last_login')->nullable();
			$table->string('persist_code')->nullable();
			$table->string('reset_password_code')->nullable();
			$table->string('first_name')->nullable();
			$table->string('last_name')->nullable();
			$table->timestamps();

			// We'll need to ensure that MySQL uses the InnoDB engine to
			// support the indexes, other engines aren't affected.
			$table->engine = 'InnoDB';
			$table->unique('email');
			$table->index('activation_code');
			$table->index('reset_password_code');
		});
	}

	/**
	 * Reverse the migrations.
	 *
	 * @return void
	 */
	public function down()
	{
		Schema::drop('users');
	}

}
