Setup Vuex with external file [https://vuex.vuejs.org/installation.html](https://vuex.vuejs.org/installation.html)

But after this make a file in the `resources/assets/js` called `store.js` then set it up as needed 
Here I will have one loading state

```
export default {
  state: {
    loading: true,
  },
  getters: {
    loading: state => {
      return state.loading;
    },
  },
  mutations: {
    loading(state, loading) {
      state.loading = loading;
    }
  }
};
```

now import it into your app.js

`import store from './store';`

and 

```
var app = new Vue({
  mixins: [require('spark')],
  store: new Vuex.Store(store),
  router
});
```

That should do it. I do load some state in my `resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php`

```
    <script>
        window.Laravel = {!! json_encode([
                "apiToken" => auth()->user()->api_token ?? null
            ]) !!};
    </script>
```

Just to help with some basic stuff
