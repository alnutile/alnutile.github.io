Previously I wrote about how to use [Lumen and Iron.io](https://alfrednutile.info/posts/143) this adds to that by modifying the logging technique.

As noted the worker is basically a class that sets things up, hands off the payload to the handler and returns the results.

~~~
<?php

use App\CompareFuseHandler;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\App;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\File;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log;

require_once __DIR__ . '/libs/bootstrap.php';

$payload = getPayload(true);

fire($payload);

function fire($payload)
{
    $logs = storage_path('logs/lumen.log');
    Log::info(sprintf("Starting Worker at %s", \Carbon\Carbon::now()));
    try
    {
        //Empty Logs
        $handler = App::make('App\CompareFuseHandler');
        $handler->handle($payload);
        echo "Success See Logs Below: \n";
        Log::info(sprintf("Ending Worker at %s", \Carbon\Carbon::now()));
        echo File::get($logs);
    }

    catch(\Exception $e)
    {
        echo "Error See Logs Below: \n";
        Log::info(sprintf("Ending Worker at %s", \Carbon\Carbon::now())); 
        echo File::get($logs);
    }

}
~~~

The nice thing about above is that all throughout my handler class I can start the do `Log::info('foo')` to store up a report for the end of the process on either Success or Error.
