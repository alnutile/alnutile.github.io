This took a bit. On the first site it was easy. I went through <a href="https://github.com/galetahub/ckeditor" target="_blank">these directions</a> to get ckeditor setup with paperclip.<br />
And paperclip is easy to setup with S3 but on this site you are reading now the url Amazon used was not <strong>s3</strong>.amazonaws.com/nutilesblog but <strong>s3-us-west-2</strong>.amazonaws.com/nutilesblog&nbsp;</p>

<p>Paperclip was defaulting to s3 and I had trouble getting the combinations for this setting right. Maybe I could have set the bucket to use s3 but in the end I rather deal with the s3-us-west-2 since different clients will have different needs.</p>

Finally I setup the development.rb and production.rb like this
