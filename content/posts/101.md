This is like most nginx the only trick was adding the port forward on Homestead

~~~
#scripts/homestead.rb
    # Configure Port Forwarding To The Box
    config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8000
    config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 443, host: 44300
    config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 3306, host: 33060
    config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 5432, host: 54320
    config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 11300, host: 11300
~~~

I set it to 44300

Then just follow along here
