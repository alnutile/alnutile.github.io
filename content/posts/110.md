This is key to preventing [Cross-site request forgery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery). Basically you log in and do some work on one site, then go to a malicious site and now they can send POST requests to the sites you have authentication to. But by passing a token we can prevent that issue.

The steps

  * Make a token path
  * Make a token service to use again and again in Angular.js
  * Add it as a resolve to the route in Angular.js
  * Add it to your forms
 

## Make a token path

In this case it is Laravel and I just add this route (in a Controller or route.php same idea)

~~~
    /**
     * @Get("auth/token")
     */
    public function getToken()
    {
        return csrf_token();
    }
~~~

## Make your Angular Service and inject it into the Controller

Service in this case is 

~~~
(function(){
    'use strict';

    function TokenService($http)
    {
        return {
            get: get
        };

        ////
        function get() {
            return $http.get('auth/token').then(
                success,
                fail
            );
        }

        function success(response) {
            return response;
        }

        function fail(response) {
            return response;
        }
    }

    angular
        .module('app')
        .factory('TokenService', TokenService);
})();
~~~

The ui router passes it in on this POST related route

~~~
            .state('projects_create', {
                url: '/projects/create',
                views: {
                    '': {
                        templateUrl: 'assets/js/projects/templates/projects.edit.html',
                        resolve: {
                            project: ['ProjectsService', function(ProjectsService){
                                return ProjectsService.create();
                            }],
                            token: ['TokenService', function(TokenService) {
                                return TokenService.get();
                            }]
                        },
                        controller: 'ProjectsCreateCtrl',
                        controllerAs: 'vm'
                    }
                }
            })
~~~

Since it is a promise and in the resolve we get the benefits of not loading the page till this is done loading. A nice addition here could be getting is current_user info etc.

Add it to your Angular Controller

~~~
    function ProjectsCreateCtrl(project, token, ProjectHelpers, $window, Noty)
    {
        var vm                  = this;
        vm.token                = token.data;
~~~

Later, using [Restangular](https://github.com/mgonto/restangular), during the post I add it to the payload. So when the user clicks Create Project they trigger this.

~~~
function saveProject()
        {
            vm.rest.route = 'api/v1/projects';
            vm.rest._token  = vm.token;
            vm.rest.post()
                .then(function(response) {
                    vm.success(response);
                }, function(response){
                    vm.fail(response);
                });
        }
~~~ 

That is it. You can see it in the form

![form](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/hilfee68v8acyx7/intheform.png?dl=0)

And you can remove it to show the form fail.

You can also see it in the payload we are posting.
