Using Laravel's built in Cache facade is super easy. I will quickly cover how to use it for showing your Posts and showing a Post.


## Example 1 Show a Post

This example will first check the Cache to see if there is a match for post_ID of the post if not it will make one. Also I happen to do the same for the sidebar.

~~~
public function show($id)
	{
        $post = Cache::rememberForever('post_' . $id, function() use ($id)
        {
            return Post::findOrFail($id);
        });

        $posts = Cache::rememberForever('posts_sidebar', function()
        {
            return Post::all()->sortBy("created_at", null, TRUE);
        });

        $active = $post->id;
		return View::make('posts.show', compact('post', 'posts', 'active'));
	}
~~~

Of course this could be moved into a Service and out of the Controller.

It really is that simple

## All Posts

Same thing. 

If you are not authenticated, eg all users but me, and there is no posts cache make one else show it.

~~~
if(Auth::user()) {

            $posts = Post::OrderByCreatedAt()->get();

        } else {

            $posts = Cache::rememberForever('posts', function()
            {
                return Post::Published()->OrderByCreatedAt()->get();
            });

}
~~~


##  Clearing Cache

For this I made a PostsObeserver Class

This will reset Cache for the related caches whenever a post is made or updated.

~~~
<?php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Cache;

class PostObserver {


    public function saved($model)
    {
        foreach(['posts_sidebar', 'posts'] as $value)
        {
            Cache::forget($value);
        }

        Cache::forget('post_' . $model->id);
    }
}
~~~

Then I register it in the model 

~~~

    public static function boot()
    {
        parent::boot();
        Post::observe(new PostObserver());
    }
~~~
