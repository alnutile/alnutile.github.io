<p>Been working about a month now on a Ruby on Rails project. The goal of the product is to make a site that can be spun up numerous times as a Saas product. I has to include&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>CMS elements</li>
	<li>Settings area to change logo, colors etc.</li>
	<li>Connect to a remote SOAP API to create cloneable content from and users.</li>
	<li>User admin area with Roles</li>
	<li>Reporting</li>
	<li>Ckeditor that integrates with Paperclip on non-cms pages.</li>
	<li>Heroku deployment strategy</li>
</ol>

<p>It really has been a fun project as I get to see all the great gems out there that make alot of this possible without a ton of custom work. Though unlike other frameworks I have used it is super easy to customize the MVC parts of the gems as needed which has made my work a ton more enjoyable.</p>

<p>Some of the gems used so far</p>

<ol>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/savonrb/savon" target="_blank">Savon</a> to talk to the SOAP API</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip" target="_blank">Paperclip</a> Gem to manage images with Amazon S3&nbsp;</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/devise" target="_blank">Devise</a> to help with authentication and signup</li>
	<li><a href="http://refinerycms.com/" target="_blank">RefineryCMS</a> to provide the highly customizable CMS part to this&nbsp;</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/vcr/vcr" target="_blank">VCR</a> to help mock up the tests&nbsp;</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/galetahub/ckeditor" target="_blank">Ckeditor</a> with Rails and Paperclip Integration&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p>I am finalizing the VCR test now. I did not do TDD on that part of the project since the IT on the other end where still working out the endpoints in the API. VCR has been a great help there to speed up the tests. And of course <a href="http://RailsCasts.com" target="_blank">RailsCasts.com</a> for going over both Savon and VCR!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A demo of the project can be seen here as well.</p>
