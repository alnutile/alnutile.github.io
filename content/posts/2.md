Going Angular

<p>
Took some time to rewrite my drupal/bootstrap site into Angular.js and slim php.
Using slim and a seed project I quickly had a rest api to get the different content types, Blog, Page etc.
I am using the Page content type to make other dynamic parts to the site like Footer and Header.
</p>
<p>
After a quick migration from drupal to a more basic MySQL db layout (soon mongodb?) I put together a Angular.js 
front end.</p>
<p>
Still have a ton to learn about Angular and I figure this will only help. I will post some notes soon on Angular for a different
project I am working on.

Some good links
<br>
<strong>Angular</strong>
<br>
http://angularjs.org/
<br>
They have a great tutorial there.

<strong>Great Seed for a Project</strong>

This seems like it could have been a good starter to build out the site

But I already had a Twitter Bootstrap theme in place and ready.
