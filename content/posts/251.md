There is a good episode here [https://www.phproundtable.com/episode/using-static-analyzers-to-improve-our-php-codebases](https://www.phproundtable.com/episode/using-static-analyzers-to-improve-our-php-codebases) that talks about this.

The short of it is that it can easily catch some issues that your tests or IDE did not. For example I had a class name overlap due to a typo and it found it.  From there it will output tons of other info that may just help guide you in your work.

The install is super easy as seen in the docs [https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan)

For me I did

```
composer global require phpstan/phpstan
```

then in my `composer.json` I added 

```
"scripts": {
				//see last row but here are some other nice quick shortcuts
				"check-style": "phpcs -p --standard=PSR2 --runtime-set ignore_errors_on_exit 1 --runtime-set ignore_warnings_on_exit 1 app",
        "fix-style": "phpcbf -p --standard=PSR2 --runtime-set ignore_errors_on_exit 1 --runtime-set ignore_warnings_on_exit 1 app",
        "check-metrics": "phpmetrics --report-json=report.json app && vendor/bin/quality_run_check.py report.json",
        "check-metrics-html": "phpmetrics --report-json=report.json --report-html=report app && open report/index.html",
        "phpstan": "phpstan analyse app"
}
```

The initial run found this 

```
Cannot declare class App\Observers\QualityReport because the name is already in use in /Users/alfrednutile/Code/cat-quality-service/app/Observers/QualityReport.php on line 7
```

which was great since I did not catch that in my tests. Another run found a missing variable for my printf which was in an exception area I did not test.

This may help as well [https://github.com/nunomaduro/larastan](https://github.com/nunomaduro/larastan) for Laravel

This will avoid some Facade and other issues. Even just trying

```
php artisan code:analyse --paths=app --level=0
```

Found some issues I did not see, for example object properties I did not define at the top of the Class.
