Quick Install Steps

## Vagrant and Homestead 

This was easy I just followed these steps [here](http://sherriflemings.blogspot.ca/2015/03/laravel-homestead-on-windows-8.html) and I was done. For me I used Vmware but Virtualbox is fine.

## Windows in Selenium

Two easy steps

### Step 1 Install Node.js SUPER EASY

[https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Install the .exe, restart your console and you have node!

### Step 2 Install Selenium

Just go here and you are done!
[https://www.npmjs.com/package/selenium-standalone](https://www.npmjs.com/package/selenium-standalone)

After those steps I run it in a powershell and the server is running and I am set to use it.

## Final Touches

In my VM I "sudo vim /etc/hosts" and point it to my selenium on windows using the domain "selenium.dev"

~~~
192.168.7.57    selenium.dev
~~~

Then my behat.yml looks like this

So when I run this inside the VM it knows to talk to the exteral version of Selenium

default:
    suites:
        home_ui:
            paths: [ %paths.base%/features/home]
            contexts: [ HomePageUiContext ]
    extensions:
        Laracasts\Behat:
            env_path: .env.behat
        Behat\MinkExtension:

            base_url: https://recipes.dev
