This is setup for Laravel but can work for any app. Most of this is due to the great [Laracasts on Gulp](https://laracasts.com/lessons/gulp-this)

Download and setup gulp

First make a package.json file in the root of your app and just put curly brackets in it.
~~~
touch package.json
vim package.json
~~~

~~~
//package.json
{

}
~~~

Then run the needed node commands

~~~
npm install -g gulp
npm install gulp --save-dev
npm install gulp-notify --save-dev
npm install gulp-phpunit --save-dev
~~~

Now the package.json should look like this thanks to the save switch.

~~~
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "gulp": "^3.6.2",
    "gulp-phpunit": "^0.5.3",
    "gulp-notify": "^1.3.0"
  }
}
~~~

Now to setup the gulpfile, again in the root of your app

~~~
//gulpfile.js
var phpunit = require('gulp-phpunit');

var gulp = require('gulp'),
    notify  = require('gulp-notify'),
    phpunit = require('gulp-phpunit');

gulp.task('phpunit', function() {
    var options = {debug: false, notify: true};
    gulp.src('app/tests/*.php')
        .pipe(phpunit('', options))
        .on('error', notify.onError({
            title: "Failed Tests!",
            message: "Error(s) occurred during testing..."
        }));
});

gulp.task('default', function(){
    gulp.run('phpunit');
    gulp.watch('app/**/*.php', function(){
        gulp.run('phpunit');
    });
});
~~~


Basically we are saying watch the app folder recursively for file changes to files ending in php then run all the tests in app/tests/*.php.

Finally run gulp at the command line and it will run keeping an eye on changes.

~~~
gulp
~~~

That is it. From here you will get typically phpunit output as you work BUT also a notice if you break something.
