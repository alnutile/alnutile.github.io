This was an issue for me using sqlite. There was a simple fix noted in the [irclogs](http://irclogs.laravel.io/2014-03-02/04:41#log-5312b66d1937b8f547005cde) of Laravel!

So under my require-dev or require I placed
~~~
//composer.json
	"require": {
		"laravel/framework": "4.1.*",
		"way/generators": "dev-master",
        "doctrine/dbal": "~2.3"
    },
~~~

ran composer update and all was well again!
