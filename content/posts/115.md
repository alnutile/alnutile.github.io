As we start to move off of Forge I still want the automation to take place after all tests pass. 

In Codeship or Locally I just follow some instructions from here [http://laravel.com/docs/4.2/ssh](http://laravel.com/docs/4.2/ssh)

# Locally

Setup Envoy globally as noted.

Run envoy init

And then I pasted this into my Envoy.blade.php

~~~
@servers(['dev' => 'behat_dev'])

@task('deploy_dev', ['on' => 'dev'])
    date
    cd /home/forge/foo-dev
    git pull origin dev
    composer config -g github-oauth.github.com sometoken
    composer install
    composer dump-autoload
    php artisan dump-autoload
    php artisan migrate
    php artisan migrate:refresh --seed
    ~/node_modules/bower/bin/bower install
    npm install
    php artisan queue:restart
@endtask
~~~

# Setup you .ssh config

The behat_dev is a shortcut to the server I made in my ~/.ssh/config

~~~
Host foo_dev
    Hostname 104.111.111.111
    User forge
~~~


So now locally I can run

~~~
envoy run deploy_dev
~~~

# Codeship

Setup the server

~~~
sudo composer global require "laravel/envoy=~1.0"
~~~

Edit your ~/.ssh/config

~~~
Host behat_dev
  Hostname localhost
  User forge
~~~

Make sure to put your key into authorized keys

~~~
cd .ssh
cat id_rsa.pub >> authorized_keys
~~~

Try logging in 

~~~
ssh behat_dev
~~~

Then setup codeship

Under the Deployment settings use script

~~~
ssh forge@104.111.111.111 'cd ~/foo-dev && envoy run deploy_dev'
~~~

Make sure you codeship public key is also on the destination server
