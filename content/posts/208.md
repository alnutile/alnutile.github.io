In this example I get a message from Slack (but this can be any message) and then send results back to Slack.

One thing to keep in mind you really want to get your code working out side of Slack since you cannot easily do a push, test, fix, push, test as we normally do when working locally with a browser.

Get your PHPUnit working for a class that will handle the payload, then you know when you plug it in to the Slack Route it will "just work".

More on that shortly...

### Getting a message
Going with the POST settings we will setup Slack to send a POST request to a URL we are building.

So I will show some tests first [here](https://gist.github.com/alnutile/822ec5907a4752b74d38dd63e6eeba39#file-runreportslacktest-php) and then trait [here](https://gist.github.com/alnutile/822ec5907a4752b74d38dd63e6eeba39#file-slacktrait-php)
 
We have a few features going on to consider

All of which I use this fixture to replicate the incoming Slack Message 

```
[
  {"token": "foo"},
  {"team_id": "bar"},
  {"team_domain": "baz"},
  {"channel_id": "C0JKRSDEV"},
  {"channel_name": "test"},
  {"user_id": "U02NC4UL2"},
  {"user_name": "alfrednutile"},
  {"command": "/hp:report"},
  {"text": "not really needed yet"},
  {"response_url": "https://hooks.slack.com/commands/foo/bar/baz"}
]
```	

see [here](https://gist.github.com/alnutile/822ec5907a4752b74d38dd63e6eeba39#file-slack_incoming_run_report-json) too.

#### Is this coming from the right token?

`testSuccessVerifiesToken`  and bad `testVerifiesToken`

see example [here](https://gist.github.com/alnutile/822ec5907a4752b74d38dd63e6eeba39#file-runreportslacktest-php-L34)

### Is this even coming from Slack?

`testSuccessSlackURL` and `testFailWrongURL`

see example [here](https://gist.github.com/alnutile/822ec5907a4752b74d38dd63e6eeba39#file-runreportslacktest-php-L61)

### Is this person even allowed to do this?

`testSuccessVerifiesPerson`
see example [here](https://gist.github.com/alnutile/822ec5907a4752b74d38dd63e6eeba39#file-runreportslacktest-php-L49)

### Is there info/text in the incoming message for me to consider

`testKeepSheetsAsTrue` shows me looking for text.  

Again easy stuff to test outside of Slack. [here](https://gist.github.com/alnutile/822ec5907a4752b74d38dd63e6eeba39#file-runreportslacktest-php-L95)

## Okay Now the message is good how to send one back?

The route has to  becomes a non-auth and non-basic auth protected route so Slack can POST to it

Here is my `nginx` `default.conf`config (see docs on how to update this using CloudFormation)

```
location  /api/v1/slack/ { auth_basic "off"; allow all; satisfy any; try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string; }
```

To allow this to happen see the full file here LINK.

Then the route is simple `routes/api.php`

```
Route::group(['prefix' => 'v1'], function(){
    Route::post('slack/hp_reports', 'RunReportSlackController@handle');
    Route::post('slack/hp_user_reports', 'RunUserLevelReportSlackController@handle');

});
```

The Controller [here](https://gist.github.com/alnutile/822ec5907a4752b74d38dd63e6eeba39#file-runuserlevelreportslackcontroller-php-L21) does as little work as possible.

Though I would like to move these into a Validation 

```
            if(!$this->token) {
                $this->setToken(env('SLACK_TOKEN_REPORT_REQUEST'));
            }

            if($this->notASlackUrl($request)) {
                $message = sprintf("Not a Slack URL");
                throw new NotSlackUrlException($message);
            }

```

Again the Controller should not have to do too much.

But the logic is outside the controller and which now is outside the scope of the example since at this point we just have, as seen in the fixture above so do what you want with the incoming JSON.

Once done it sends it back to the Controller [here](https://gist.github.com/alnutile/822ec5907a4752b74d38dd63e6eeba39#file-runuserlevelreportslackcontroller-php-L43) to respond back to Slack using `respondToSlack` seen in `SlackTrait.php`  [here](https://gist.github.com/alnutile/822ec5907a4752b74d38dd63e6eeba39#file-slacktrait-php-L89)

Which simple breaks it up into an array

```
    public function respondToSlack($message, $attachment, $type = 'in_channel')
    {
        return ['response_type' => $type, 'text' => $message, 'attachments' => [ ['text' =>  $attachment ] ] ];
    }
```


Attachments in this case just being more text.  For our team you can see it when you type `/sd behat` in Slack. This request goes to our app, looks for the word(s) behat in the docs and replies back to Slack as such

```
slash-command APP [11:43 AM] 
Your original search slack total found 3
Title: Holiday and other Team Processes URL: https://foo.com/team-managment
Title: Getting Started New to the Team URL: https://foo.com/new-to-the-team
Title: Onboarding Links URL: https://foo.com/onboarding-links
```

"Your original search slack total found 3" in the text and the rest the "attachments" is the results we get from Slack

## ENV
One tricky part here is the `.env` 

I am looking for `SLACK_TOKEN` but this will get old soon if I do a few of these since they all have different tokens.  I would suggest an `config/slack.php` to then have areas for this.  

```
<?php

return [
    'slack_report' => env('SLACK_TOKEN_FEATURE_FOO', '12345'),
];
```
