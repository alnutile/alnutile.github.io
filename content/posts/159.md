# Laravel 5.1 and Oauth2 Server


Video coming soon...

Example repo is here [https://github.com/alnutile/oauth_how_to](https://github.com/alnutile/oauth_how_to)

The library we will use is 

[https://github.com/lucadegasperi/oauth2-server-laravel](https://github.com/lucadegasperi/oauth2-server-laravel)

This will setup a server both client_type and password_type for Grant Types.

# Coming to Terms with Oauth

Coming to terms with this stuff is long and tedious.
The docs are here [https://github.com/lucadegasperi/oauth2-server-laravel/](https://github.com/lucadegasperi/oauth2-server-laravel/) wiki will help and then these lead to the League docs as well [http://oauth2.thephpleague.com/](http://oauth2.thephpleague.com/) 

There is also a podcast interview with the Alex Bilbie who made the League Oauth Library [http://fullstackradio.com/episodes/4/](http://fullstackradio.com/episodes/4/)

What I will cover is mainly the instalation going beyond the docs above into the details of getting this thing going. I will also provide a "play" repo for you to review.

## Base Laravel Install 

If you want to use this demo to play around just run `composer install` and see the migration info below.

Install laravel as normal, install the library as normal. You will see some extra stuff I have in the repo for helping out as well (this will be seen in the video too)

`app/OauthTools`

Some commands to use artisan to make users, tokens etc.

So in the end my `app/Console/Kernel.php` looked like [https://github.com/alnutile/oauth_how_to/blob/master/app/Console/Kernel.php](https://github.com/alnutile/oauth_how_to/blob/master/app/Console/Kernel.php)

So I could easily do

~~~
php artisan oauth-tools:adduser admin@foo.com
~~~

![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/4oz4yn8p8gxftt2/make_user_oauth.png?dl=0)

or 

~~~
php artisan oauth-tools:generate-token 33591b34-03c2-4ece-a763-d531aee0298a admin@foo.com client
~~~

Also note [composer.json](https://github.com/alnutile/oauth_how_to/blob/master/composer.json) I use a uuid library to help with these commands etc.


Finally to have all of this work out of the box with the Postman file I shared run it this way for now

~~~
cd public
php -S localhost:8181
~~~

The database for this example is sqlite so

~~~
touch storage/database.sqlite
php artisan migrate:refresh --seed
~~~

And you should now have a db and migrations

Since it is sqlite just rm the file and touch it again to re-migrate and save your self the headache of DBAL driver etc since this just just a quick working demo.

## Setup your oauth config

`config/oauth2.php` file as seen [here](https://github.com/alnutile/oauth_how_to/blob/master/config/oauth2.php) **BUT** only if you want these. And my `access_token_ttl` is way too big so see the defaults in the docs. Also note it points to [OauthPasswordVerifier](https://github.com/alnutile/oauth_how_to/blob/master/app/OauthPasswordVerifier.php) which the docs talk about as well.

## Route

As noted you add the code to your route 

~~~
Route::post('oauth/access_token', function() {
    return Response::json(Authorizer::issueAccessToken());
});


Route::get('test', ['middleware' => 'oauth', function() {
    return Response::json("Welcome");
}]);
~~~

Later on you will see this instead

~~~
Route::post('oauth/access_token', function() {
    return Response::json(Authorizer::issueAccessToken());
});


Route::get('test', ['middleware' => 'oauthOrAuth', function() {
    return Response::json("Welcome");
}]);
~~~

With the **oauthOrAuth** I will explain that in the video as well. But basically and api endpoint can be used by a local session based user and a remote application using oauth. It is just how our APIs go.

So this lets that work just fine.

## Postman 

Just to show it all working you will see in the video me using postman. You will see that in the repo [here](https://github.com/alnutile/oauth_how_to/blob/master/oauth_try_2.json.postman_collection)


## Now What

Between the links above and Postman you have a working
