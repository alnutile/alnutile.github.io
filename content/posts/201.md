Note to self. Getting this error "Error Failed to connect to Pusher" but the front end is working. And you know your credentials are correct, AND it was working just a day ago check the date and time on your machine/vm. 

Mine had drift and since it was behind by 20 minutes I would end up with this error.

Oy what a waste or time x 2 :(
