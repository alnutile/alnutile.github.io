Since I know this will happen again I want to remind myself and others how to fix it.

I had this error `A VirtualBox machine with the name 'homestead' already exists.` when doing my normal vagrant up. I got some help at [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26993903/a-virtualbox-machine-with-the-name-homestead-already-exists](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26993903/a-virtualbox-machine-with-the-name-homestead-already-exists) but it was not made too clear.


Here are the exact steps for me to fix this

Run `vboxmanage list vms`

This will output a list

~~~
"homestead" {5dc30604-8ebe-4060-8966-4881958e6bf5}
"boot2docker-vm" {38af33d4-7ebc-4498-a80e-39711a08b413}
"settler_default_1434987271004_24349_1440846292799_16470" {2c80bf94-99b8-4b51-95a0-034dddae8c33}
~~~

Then I took the id of homestead `5dc30604-8ebe-4060-8966-4881958e6bf5` and did

~~~
echo '5dc30604-8ebe-4060-8966-4881958e6bf5' > ~/Homestead/.vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/id
~~~


**UPDATE**

Rough day. Like I said this rarely happens but in this case I also had the `default: Warning: Authentication failure. Retrying...` error so I did this

~~~
cd /tmp
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitchellh/vagrant/master/keys/vagrant.pub
cat vagrant.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
~~~
